        <div class="projectTitle">Rome's Pizza Website Redesign</div>
        <p>
            Stringy, fresh mozzarella; a crust so crispy its crack can be heard over the voices in the crowded restaurant; and, the unique amalgamation of Mediterranean flavors
            in a freshly baked pizza have made Rome's Pizza a household favorite. However, after struggling to order my favorite Taj Mahal Pizza through their online system,
            I decided to redesign it so that others can experience amazing pizza at its finest!
        </p>
        <p>
            With this school project, I wanted to practice redesigning a responsive website, improve at analyzing
            usability problems in various interfaces, and develop accurate low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
        </p>
        <p style="align-self: center;"><b>Check out the original website and maybe even order a pie!</b></p>
        <img class="ver" src="./images/RPScreenshot.png" alt="original website" style="align-self: center;">  
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="pSubtitle">Usability Problems</div>
        <p>Before beginning my design, I evaluated what usability problems exist within the original website:</p>
        <ol class="problemList">
            <li class="problem">Clickable text is not well distinguished. For example, The PROBLEMS ORDERING? text is an uncomprehendable element and a button would
                be much clearer. The same goes for MENU and LOG IN.</li>
            <li class="problem">The phone number is followed by (Change), which is clickable. This is not immediately noticeable and has an inconsistent format with PROBLEMS ORDERING?
                Clicking this text allows you to change the Rome's Pizza location that you are ordering from, however, 
                this is repetitive because there is a Change Location button.</li>
            <li class="problem">Changing the order type is not immediately noticeable and can be handled in SCHEDULE ORDER.</li>
            <li class="problem">Though green and orange form a color harmony, the colors make the text difficult to read, especially since the text is small and unresponsive.
                Furthermore, the company's logo is green and red, and therefore, the color scheme is inconsistent.
            </li>
            <li class="problem">Image quality is poor.</li>
            <li class="problem">The salad description is for pizzas and has a typo with "Served".</li>
            <li class="problem">Menu items are cluttered and lack vertical spacing, making it difficult to navigate.</li>
            <li class="problem">The logo is out of place and does not fit with the background.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="pSubtitle">Accessibilty</div>
        <p>
            I used WebAIM WAVE and the JAWS screen-reader to evaluate the original website's accessiblity. There were no errors or issues
            regarding's the website's color contrasts, however, WAVE noted that the webpage was missing a heading and page regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the webpage was not very accessible when using a screen-reader. JAWS was only able to access the SCHEDULE ORDER and View/Change Location 
            buttons. None of the food categories were selectable by the screen-reader and all text that were hyperlinks were unaccessible. Finally,
            none of the pictures have an Alt tag so the screen-reader does not read what each of the options are.

    <div id="lowfi" class="container">
        <div class="pSubtitle">Low-Fidelity Wireframing</div>
            <p>Using my notes, I created wireframes to plan out my design on different devices:</p>

          Accessibilty Observations
        </div>
        <p>I then evaluated my design the same way that I evaluated the original website:</p>
        <ul class="problemList">
          <li class="problem">
            I checked that my redesign scaled naturally on a mobile phone, tablet, and desktop. Since I used @media queries, I was able to adjust the formatting for each device.
          </li>
          <li class="problem">
            I changed the browser's font size to see whether the font size adjusted well. Though, my font size did not change, my font is readable on all devices
            because it was adjusted using @media queries.
          </li>
          <li class="problem">
            I tested my redesign with different languages like Korean and Japanese, and my website was able to translate most fields. Since some of my titles are images,
            those were not translated, but all other texts translated well.
          </li>
          <li class="problem">
            The only issue shown by WebAIM WAVE was that there was not enough contrast between the text and the background in the footer. The program also noted that my 
            website does not have a header, however, it noted that there were 13 alternative texts identified.
          </li>
          <li class="problem">
            Using the JAWS screen-reader my website was able to navigate to all of the buttons, except for the pictures. However, since my pictures had an Alt tag, it
            was able to read those aloud.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="pSubtitle">
        Insights and Takeaways
      </div>
      <ul class="insightList">
        <li class="insight">
            I learned that it is critical to assess whether a website is accessible to every user, how easily it allows the user to complete a task, and if the layout is intuitive and
            learnable.
        </li>
        <li class="insight">
            I found that animations that respond to user actions greatly increase a website's usability, and familiar layouts
            allow users to quickly learn and remember how to use a webpage.
