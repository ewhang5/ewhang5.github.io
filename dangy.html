          <p>
            According to the NY Post, we waste 10,368 hours of our lives deciding what to eat. To solve this problem,
             185M people spend hours searching through Google or Yelp, only to order a dish that often doesn’t fit their
             tastes. This is because a high restaurant rating doesn’t mean you’ll order something you like as these
             platforms don’t know your taste profile. To exacerbate this problem, many people are not introduced to new
             restaurants or dishes by the restaurants themselves, because most restaurants “only promote to existing
             customers”. This is because advertising is unaffordable for most restaurants, especially small, independent
             restaurants. Yelp for Business and Google AdWords use a bidding process that can drive the cost-per-click to
             $40! This is unaffordable, especially when 85% of businesses rated Yelp for Business one-star and Forbes says
             that “AdWords just doesn’t fit.”

          <p>
            Introducing Dangy, a mobile app that custom-recommends restaurant dishes you’ll love! Dangy uses AI to
              assess your taste profile, crowdsource restaurant dish reviews, find users with similar tastes as you,
              and analyze ingredients in dishes to recommend the best ones for you! Unlike our competitors, Dangy
              recommends dishes fit for your tastes so you can confidently order without spending hours searching. After,
              Dangy curates a list of the top dishes you need to try, Dang-it! Rate dishes on taste, spiciness, and value,
              and share fun, TikTok-like videos! For restaurants, Dangy offers affordable advertising at 5% of the dish
              price. Dangy’s dish ads are also the most effective because we match them with users who would love those
              dishes to increase click-through and conversion rates. Finally, we offer restaurants a subscription service
              to answer their biggest question: “Why don’t customers like certain dishes?” We increase customer
              satisfaction and retention.

          <p>
            To build Dangy, I used React Native and JavaScript for the frontend and incorporated 12 AWS services for a scalable
              backend, including S3, Lambda and DynamoDB for media storage, ad hoc serverless compute, and millisecond response-time database
              querying. For the AI model, I employed vector quantization with K-Means Clustering and logistic regression
              to draw relationships between users’ taste profiles; Word2Vec, which uses Natural Language Processing to
              map word associations for dish descriptions; and, an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning model to improve
              recommendation accuracy.

              Dangy has worked with the CEOs of Lake Forest Venture Management, Seated, and BetaXAnalytics while
                participating in Brown University’s startup accelerator Breakthrough-Lab. Dangy’s use of AI to recommend
                the best dishes for each user also led me to confer with AI experts like Greggory Elias, founder of
                Skim AI, and Daniel Ritchie, a Brown University AI professor.

              Dangy is for everyone! But we’re starting with the 139M US millennials and Gen-Z’s. This group is 99% more
                likely to rely on social media and online reviews and eat out two out of every three days, which translates
                to 34B meals per year that we can influence. To quantify this, a 5% conversion rate on cost-per-click yields
                over $1B per year in revenue, and a 5% conversion to our subscription service yields $50M yearly. And that’s
                just in the US. The world has 15x the number of restaurants. We’ve already received interest from advertising
                agencies and food influencers, who collectively have over 866k followers, and have released our Alpha
                which correctly predicts a given user’s dish rating 91% of the time. Sign up and be the first to “fall
                in love at first dish”!
