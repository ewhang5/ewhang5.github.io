        <p>
            Kuleana is a startup that specializes in plant based raw tuna. There are several companies that
            make vegetable based meat substitutes, such as Beyond Meat, but currently, there is yet to be an
            established seafood equivalent. Kuleana hopes to capitalize on this by creating 100 percent plant based, 
            sushi-grade raw tuna so that consumers can enjoy fish without the environmental and ethical consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this school project, my team and I had two weeks to design an interface for Kuleana. We drew sketches;
            created wireframes; designed an interactive, high-fidelity prototype; and, conducting user testing on our final prototype.

        <p>
            We made 16 sketches to determine which pages are most effective in informing users about the product and providing a simple
            way to purchase the product.
            We prioritized creativity, consistency and clarity.
            Here are some of our favorites:

        <div class="pSubtitle">Hi-Fi Prototype</div>
        <p>
            We used Figma to create a hi-fi prototype and made design choices based on hierarchy, interaction, and navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hierarchy:</b> 
            We modified fonts and font sizes based on the text's function. For example, we had one main title font and 
            font size. Smaller titles also followed a consistent styling and size, and we also had a consistent paragraph font size.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Interaction:</b> 
            We focused on making interactions simple. For example, we provided explicit 
            instructions on where to hover on our Mission page to eliminate any possible confusion. Furthermore, clickable elements were 
            enlarged and have a green border upon hover to make it clear that they can be clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Navigation:</b> 
            Our navbar contained the main pages of the site, which were accessible from every page. Certain pages also 
            featured buttons that would navigate to different parts of the site such as the checkout button on the shop page.

            evaluated our prototype. The following table lists the feedback we received and the changes we made in response.

                    The purchase button on the Recipe page is confusing because it is unclear whether the user is purchasing only the tuna or all components 
                    required by the recipe.
                </td>
                <td>
                    We replaced the purchase button with a download button, which we believe would be more helpful for users since we also added a Shop page to the nav bar.

                    We added an edit button next to the amount of tuna on the checkout page so users can change their order.

                <td>
                    We removed the unclickable, expanding images on the Home page to focus on simplicity and usability.

                <td>
                    Instead of having a purchase section on the home page, which may be a little aggressive, we added a shop page on the navbar.

                <td>
                    Added a shop page, which is dedicated to purchasing and now contains the information in the purchase section that was originally on the home page.

                </td>
                <td>
                    We expanded the size of the screen to eliminate the white space on the sides for 15 inch laptops.

            <tr>
                <td>
                    Font size is too big (also makes it look like it is intended for mobile).
                </td>
                <td>
                    We reduced the overall font size throughout the site.

        <p>
            With our updated prototype, we conducted our own usability tests via UserTesting.com.
            Because the purpose of our website is to give an explanation of what Kuleana is and to convert 
            browsing users into customers, we created subtasks to test whether the prototype is clear, intuitive, 
            and effective in driving purchases.

        <p><b>Subtasks</b></p>
        <ol class="subtasks">

            Though certain pages can be enhanced with more animations, 
            our tests revealed that the prototype’s consistent structure and effects contributed to an intuitive user experience. Therefore, we would look to add more 
            descriptions and images to make our website more appealing and informative but be cautious of adding too many effects.
        </li>
        <li class="insight">
            This project helped show that brainstorming, collecting user feedback, and iterating over many different website designs helps create unique perspectives that lead to 
            a more creative and effective end result.
        </li>
        <li class="insight">
            Comparing our initial assumptions about workflow with our user testing feedback revealed any unintuitive or inconsistent
