            Abstract: The long-term goal is to develop an automated, real time, in 
            situ red blood cell (RBC) counting, identification, and RBC distribution 
            width calculating system using deep learning. The aim of this work was to 
            develop the deep learning model that can identify red blood cells. 200 images
             containing RBCs were annotated using Microsoft’s Visual Object Tagging Tool. 
             Using the You Only Look Once object detection public repository and Tensorflow 
             1.14.0, a deep learning model was created to identify RBCs. The 200 images were 
             used for training. The model was programmed to create a bounding box around the 
             RBC to signify that it has been recognized. The model was tested on different 
             images and it correctly identified an average of 6.51±3.14 RBCs per test image 
             as compared to 7.44±3.58 that a human was able to identify (p=1.26x10-9). The 
             model identified RBCs quite well, though not statistically as well as a human 
             being. The computer also assigned a score for each bounding box with an average 
             score of 60.62%±9.69%. This score represents the confidence the model had with 
             each cell it identified. These scores were low because the quality of the images 
             was poor. The score correlated well with the quality of the image. With more training, 
             this model shows promise in identifying RBCs. After further training, this model will 
             be used to identify RBCs in videos. Finally, it will be programmed to measure the RBC 
             diameter and calculate RDW.
