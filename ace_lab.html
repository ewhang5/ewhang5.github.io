            I researched different types of machine learning models at the Autonomous Control Engineering Lab
             (ACE Lab) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I worked with machine learning models such as
             convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks
             (GANs), autoencoders, long short-term memory models (LSTMs), and reinforcement learning models in the following projects:

          <p>
              I am currently working on a project that places roadside units on optimal positions on a map to enhance communication between cars
               and increase vehicle safety by avoiding signal interferences from the environment and buildings. Check out the GitHub for the project
               here (I have no visible contributions because all of my additions were sent to my mentor for his review before he used my code
               as he saw right):

          <div class="pSubtitle">Handwritten Digit Identifier</div>
          <p>
            This was my first deep learning model created at ACE Lab. I created a CNN that uses the MNIST handwriting datatset
             to identify handwritten numbers using Python and Keras. I used Conv2D, MaxPooling2D,
             Flatten, Dense, and Dropout layers with an Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function for my model.
             My model achieved an accuracy of 98.38%. You can check out my code <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ECVd1C_dSJtCwYpmPKWKdwvlky7ZkQrr' class="hyperlink">here</a>.

          <div class="pSubtitle">Cats vs. Dogs Image Identifier</div>
          <p>
            I created a CNN that used the cats_vs_dogs TensorFlow dataset to distinguish
             between images of cats and dogs. After importing the images, I shuffled and split the dataset to an 80:20 split
             between training and testing. I used the same layers, optimizer, and loss function from the MNIST CNN.

          <p>
            I created an LSTM that predicted the character being written using the trajectory of a pen. After importing the data,
             it was resized, reshaped, and shuffled. 67% of the data was used
             for training and the rest for testing. I created a Sequential model that used LSTM and Dense layers, an Adam optimizer,
             and categorical_crossentropy loss function.

          <p>
            I created an autoencoder that classified the type of dry bean based on its characteristics like roundness or perimeter.
             I used Pandas DataFrame to import the data and split it into 80:20 training and testing datasets. I used Dense layers with
             a ReLU activation function for the encoder and a sigmoid activation function for the decoder. My model used an Adam
             optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss function.

          <p>
            Although I was not in charge of coding this project, I was also taught how to solve the famous Traveling Salesman Problem
             that aims to find the shortest path through specified city while returning to the origin city. I was taught about simulated annealing
             and genetic algorithms and worked through the code with my mentor.
