        <p>
            Researched different types of machine learning models at the Autonomous Control Engineering Lab
             (ACE Lab) of the University of Texas at San Antonio. I learned about CNNs, RNNs, GANs, autoencoders,
             LSTMs, and reinforcement learning models.

        <div class="container">
          <div class="pSubtitle">MNIST</div>
          <p>
            This was my first deep learning model created at ACE Lab. It is a CNN that uses the MNIST handwriting datatset
             to identify handwritten numbers. I selected a random image and resized it to (28, 28, 1). I used Conv2D, MaxPooling2D,
             Flatten, Dense, and Dropout layers with an Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function for my model.

        <div class="container">
          <div class="pSubtitle">Cats vs. Dogs</div>
          <p>
            This was my second CNN that used the cats_vs_dogs tensorflow dataset to create a model that is able to distinguish
             between cats and dogs. After importing the images as a shuffled dataset, I split the dataset to an 80 to 20 split
             between training and testing while reshaping the images to (256, 256, 3). The same layers, optimizer, and loss function
             from the MNIST CNN were used.

          <div class="pSubtitle">Character Trajectory</div>
          <p>
            This was my LSTM that predicted the trajectory of a pen that was writing a character. After importing the data,
             it was resized to (2858, 109, 3), reshaped with 90 degree rotations and flips, and shuffled. 67% of the data was used
             for training and the rest for testing. The model was a sequential model that used LSTM and Dense layers, an Adam optimizer,
             and categorical_crossentropy loss function.

        <div class="container">
          <div class="pSubtitle">Dry Bean Dataset</div>
          <p>
            This was my autoencoder that found out the type of dry bean based on its characteristics like roundness or perimeter.
             I used Pandas DataFrame to import the data and split the data into 80% train and 20% test. I used Dense layers with
             a ReLU activation function for the encoder and sigmoid activation function for the decoder. The model used an Adam
             optimizer and binary_crossentropy loss function.

          <div class="pSubtitle">Traveling Salesman</div>
          <p>
            Although I was not in charge of coding this project, I was also taught how to solve the famous traveling salesman problem
             that aims to find the shortest path through every city while returning to the origin city. I was taught about simulated annealing
             and genetic algorithms and worked through the code with my mentor.

              We are now working on a project that places roadside units on optimal positions on a map. Check out the github for the project
               here (I have no visibile contribution because all of my additions were sent to my mentor for his review before he used my code
               as he saw right):
