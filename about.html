                I love UX design because it's like food. Both are an artistic puzzle that are strategically
                fit together, tell a unique story, and can breathe life into the website (or eater!). I'm passionate about creating applications
                that drag users in like how the smell of fresh-baked cookies will bring an entire family straight to the kitchen.
                UX design allows me to plate the website, giving each user exactly what they need and a bit of extra spice so that
                everyone stays full.
